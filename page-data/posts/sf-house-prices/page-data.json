Clicking on a tract displays the mean house value and mean contract rent in the selected Decennial Census year.

To better harmonize the data across time, I use the areal interpolation weights provided by the <a href='https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/Researcher/Bridging.htm'>Longitudinal Tract Database</a>, which update the old tract geometries to 2010 census tract boundaries.</p>\n<p>Mean house values are inflated to real 2020 dollars based on the first half average of 2020 and the average annual <a href='https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?cu'>CPIs</a> for more consistent comparison across time.  The extruded height of each census tract is (inflated mean house value / 100) meters off the map. Individual tract mean house values may suffer from measurement error for a few reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For tracts where aggregate value is not reported, mean values are calculated based on a weighted sum of the counts for each house value bracket e.g. the number of houses that cost $300,000 to $400,000 times $350,000. For the top value bracket, e.g. $1,000,000 or more, I assume 1.5*top value.</li>\n<li>Converting the old tract geometries to the current 2010 geometries is far from perfect. Scaling and combining the counts based on geographic areal interpolation introduces potential measurement error. </li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/sf-house-prices","tagSlugs":["/tag/mapping/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-10-03T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Interactive map of San Francisco housing prices stretching back to the 1970s.","tags":["Mapping"],"title":"San Francisco Bay Area House Prices","subtitle":"1970 to Today","socialImage":"/media/sf-buildableland.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/sf-house-prices"}}}
